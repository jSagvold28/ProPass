### What is encryption

In simple terms:

Encryption is the process of transforming information or data into a secret code or language that can only be understood by someone who has the "key" to decrypt it. This is done to protect the information from being accessed or understood by unauthorized parties.

In the context of digital communication and storage, encryption involves using complex algorithms to scramble the original data, making it unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the encryption key.

When the encrypted data needs to be accessed, the recipient uses the decryption key to reverse the encryption process and reveal the original data. Encryption is used in a variety of contexts, such as online banking, messaging apps, file storage, and other situations where privacy and security are important.

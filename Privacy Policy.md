# ProPass CLI Password Manager - Privacy Policy

ProPass is a simple password manager that is available as a command-line interface (CLI). It is designed to provide users with a secure way to store and manage their passwords without collecting any data from the user. ProPass relies on two-factor authentication (2FA) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to provide maximum security to its users.

## Using ProPass

To use ProPass, simply run the program from the command line. You will be prompted to enter a master password that will be used to encrypt your passwords. Please ensure that your master password is unique and strong.

Once you have entered your master password, you can start adding passwords to ProPass. ProPass allows you to store passwords for various online services, and you can add, view, update, and delete passwords as needed.

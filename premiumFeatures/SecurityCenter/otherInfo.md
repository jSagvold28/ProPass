## What is Security Center

A Security Center is a place to secure your ProPass account. It helps you protect your personal information by allowing you to create a master password, which adds an extra layer of security to your account. This password is unique and harder for unauthorized users to guess or crack, making it less vulnerable to hacking.

In addition to a master password, the Security Center also offers multi-factor authentication. This means you have to provide additional information to prove your identity, such as a verification code sent to your phone or a biometric scan, like a fingerprint or face recognition. This adds an extra layer of protection to your account, making it even harder for unauthorized users to gain access.

By using 2-factor or multi-factor authentication, you can help ensure that only authorized users have access to your account. This is important because it reduces the risk of hacking or other security breaches. The Security Center is a powerful tool to help you keep your personal information safe and secure while using ProPass.

In summary, the Security Center is a centralized location designed to help you protect and secure your ProPass account. By creating a master password and using 2-factor or multi-factor authentication, you can add extra layers of protection to your account, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and keeping your personal information safe.

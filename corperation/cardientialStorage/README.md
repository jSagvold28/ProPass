# Cardiential Storage

## Usage

We have a preset files for some of the basic cardientials.

## Other Cardientials

If you have other cardientials that you would like to store that I don't have. Please find the customCardientialSupport.lua, that file for custom support. Like: API's, Adresses, ect.

# Requesting Custom Cardiential Support

Please create an Issue to let me know that you would like to do that. Please toggle the label 'feature request' Also, you can fork this repo and go to format.md and use that to format your own Cardential Store 

Thanks!

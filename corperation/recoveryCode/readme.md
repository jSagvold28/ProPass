# ProPass Password Manager - Corporate Recovery Code

## What is a corporate recovery code?

A corporate recovery code is a unique code that is generated by ProPass when an employee creates their account or is assigned one by the corporate administrator. This code is a crucial component of the account recovery process, as it enables the corporate administrator to reset an employee's password and gain access to their ProPass account in the event that the employee forgets their master password or is unable to access their account for any reason.

## What do you reccomend for a recovery code:

It is **VERY** important that you use a code that no one in the public would know, becuase if you need to regain access to your corperation ProPass account after getting hacked. You would need to know that to regain access to your account. It is reccomended to **NOT** share it to a lot of people. Or people that you do **not** trust.
